# TO-DO-Scheduler
A TO-DO App in where you can schedule anything and it will remind you !


Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time. There are so many versions of it it is hard to in down it's exact origin. There are claims that the famuos writer of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain invented his own version. I googled it and whatever it is, it looks more like a way of trying to figure out how much tax you owe rather than match cards.

In this repo, I will be putting extra focus on setting Attributes in JavaScript. If you want to learn how to use setAttritube and getAttribute effectively, please have a look at my code.

I have kept the styling at a bare miniumum for you to go wild and make it your own. Please tag me as I would LOVE to see your game!!!

## What inbuilt functions are we going to focus on?
- loops
- addEventListener
- setAttribute
- getAttribute
- set alarm
- data-name
- document.querySelector
- createElement

## Rules of TO-DO-Scheduler
- You will start by adding your to-do in the text box.
- Then you have to set timer for the task you want to do.
- Then it will remind you on your scheduled time.
- Make sure that the scheduled time is not passed.
- Make sure that your browser is not closed.
- It is good for reminding your tasks if you forget about anything while working on your PC.
